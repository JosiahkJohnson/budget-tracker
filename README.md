## Description:<a name = "Description"></a>
This budget tracking app will keep track of earnings and spendings, and help you graph them over time. It is installable, and will even work offline, though, a connection will be needed at some point while it's running to update the database.

## Installation Requirements:<a name = "Installation"></a>
In the top right corner of the url in your browser, there should be a button to install. In chrome, it looks like a plus sign, most browsers support progressive web apps, PC or mobile, but if it doesn't work in your brower, try chrome. 

As for running it from the repository, simply npm i and the package.json file should help npm install the proper packages to run. Make sure you have a mongo database running in the background if running this as your own build.

## Usage:<a name = "Usage"></a>
Each spending or earning requires a name and an amount. Enter a positive number and hit the add or subtract button to add or remove funds from the main tracker at the top.
